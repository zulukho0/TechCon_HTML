# 🌐 TechCon 2024 Conference Website

Hi there! 👋 I'm building a full-featured website for the **TechCon 2024** conference using only HTML. This project is designed to sharpen my foundational web development skills while giving me hands-on experience creating and organizing real-world webpages.

## 💡 What I'm Creating

I'm designing a multi-page website with five core sections:

- **Homepage (`index.html`)**  
  This is the landing page that introduces TechCon 2024 and guides users through the site.

- **About Page (`about.html`)**  
  Here, I dive into TechCon’s history, mission, and some of the exciting speakers.

- **Schedule Page (`schedule.html`)**  
  This page features a structured table showing all the events, sessions, and speaker times.

- **Register Page (`register.html`)**  
  A user-friendly form lives here so attendees can easily sign up for the conference.

- **Contact Page (`contact.html`)**  
  This final page includes all the ways to connect with TechCon: email, social media, a Google Map embed, and a form to send messages directly.

## 🧠 Skills I'm Practicing

This project is helping me strengthen my understanding of core HTML concepts, including:

- Structuring pages with semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`
- Organizing content with headings (`<h1>`–`<h6>`) and paragraphs
- Linking pages together with `<a>` tags
- Displaying information with tables using `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tr>` tags
- Designing forms with `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and dropdowns
- Enhancing visuals with `<img>`, `<video>`, and `<iframe>`


## 🛠️ My Goals

By the end of this project, I’ll be able to:
- Build clean, semantic, and accessible websites using HTML alone
- Understand how to structure a multi-page project from scratch
- Feel confident using forms, tables, images, and multimedia elements
- Lay the groundwork to dive deeper into styling with CSS and interactivity with JavaScript

Thanks for checking out my work! I'm excited to keep refining these pages and eventually bring them to life with styling and polish.
